        Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored,
        bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans,
        primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the
        world market for hot drinks.

        A caffè mocha also called mocaccino, is a chocolate-flavoured warm
        beverage that is a variant of a caffè latte, commonly served in a glass
        rather than a mug. Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also
        be referred to as hot chocolate with a shot of espresso added. Like
        cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on
        top; as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with
        whipped cream instead.</p2

        A cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a
        single, double, or triple espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface
        topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an
        espresso machine. The espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup,
        followed by a similar amount of hot milk which is prepared by heating
        and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top
        third of the drink consists of milk foam which is also made using the
        steam wand.
